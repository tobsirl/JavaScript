// Singleton Pattern
// Share a single global instance throughout our application

// Implementation Classes
let instance;
// 1. Creating the `Counter` class, which contains a `constructor`, `getInstance`, `getCount`, `increment` and `decrement` method.
// Within the constructor, we check to make sure the class hasn't already been instantiated.
class Counter {
  constructor() {
    if (instance) {
      throw new Error('You can only create one instance!');
    }
    this.counter = counter;
    instance = this;
  }

  getCount() {
    return this.counter;
  }

  increment() {
    return ++this.counter;
  }

  decrement() {
    return --this.counter;
  }
}

// 2. Setting a variable equal to the the frozen newly instantiated object, by using the built-in `Object.freeze` method.
// This ensures that the newly created instance is not modifiable.
const singletonCounter = Object.freeze(new Counter());

// 3. Exporting the variable as the `default` value within the file to make it globally accessible.
export default singletonCounter;
